%% Calculate d11B and temperature change
% To calculate the minimum Î”pH we need to know:
% - Change in measured d11B
% - Change in temperature
%
% Preperturbation
% To estimate preperturbation d11B, we take the average of the first 9
% datapoints, propagating the uncertainty on each
% For preperturbation temperature we take the average of the data linearly interpolated
% onto the ages as d11B
%
% Perturbation
% To estimate the minimum d11B, we take the average of the two lowest
% datapoints
% For perturbation temperature, we take the average of the same two
% datapoints
